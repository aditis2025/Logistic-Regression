        "   Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. Despite its name, it's used to predict categorical outcomes, typically binary outcomes like: yes/no, 1 or 0, span or not, Disease/No Disease.  \n",
        "   How it Works:  \n",
        "   1- Logistic Regression predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.  \n",
        "   2- It uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to map predicted values to a range between 0 and 1.  \n",
        "\n",
        "   Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression:  \n",
        "   Logistic Regression and Linear Regression are both supervised learning algorithms, but they serve different purposes. Linear Regression is used for regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value—such as predicting house prices, temperature, or sales. It models the relationship between input variables and a continuous output using a straight-line equation. On the other hand, Logistic Regression is used for classification problems, where the output is categorical, typically binary like yes/no, 0/1, or spam/not spam. Instead of predicting a numeric value directly, Logistic Regression predicts the probability of the input belonging to a particular class. It uses the sigmoid function to map the output between 0 and 1, making it suitable for classification tasks. While Linear Regression uses Mean Squared Error as its loss function, Logistic Regression uses Log Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss). In short, Linear Regression answers \"how much\" and Logistic Regression answers \"which category.\""

        "    Logistic Regression and Softmax Regression are both classification algorithms based on the same core idea, but they differ in their use cases and output behavior. Logistic Regression is specifically designed for binary classification problems, where the target variable has only two possible classes (e.g., 0 or 1). It uses the sigmoid function to output a probability between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood that a given input belongs to the positive class. The model has a single output unit, and the decision is made by applying a threshold (commonly 0.5) to the predicted probability.   \n",
        "    In contrast, Softmax Regression (also called Multinomial Logistic Regression) is used for multiclass classification problems, where the target variable has three or more mutually exclusive classes. Instead of a sigmoid, it uses the softmax function, which outputs a probability distribution over all classes, ensuring that the probabilities sum to 1. The class with the highest probability is chosen as the prediction. Unlike Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression has one output unit per class and considers all classes simultaneously during training."
